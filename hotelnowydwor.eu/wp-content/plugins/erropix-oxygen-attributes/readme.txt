A useful plugin to add custom attributes to Oxygen components

== Description ==
The ability to add custom html attributes for elements or tags is essential in a theme or website builder for me. This is useful and necessary for many use-cases like setting up Schema or adding the markup required by JS plugins for galleries, scrolling effects, parallax, and light-box etc.

Since the great Oxygen plugin does not have this feature built in yet, we have come up with a savvy workaround to add ANY HTML ATTRIBUTE to ANY OXYGEN ELEMENT, with an easy to use attributes manager. Our solution is stable, user friendly, and we do not use jQuery hacks or other unreliable ways to achieve this.
